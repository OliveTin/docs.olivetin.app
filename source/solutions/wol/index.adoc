=== Wake On LAN from a container

This is a simple solution that provides wake on lan capabilities from inside a container. It uses the simple `awake` command to send the magic packet. This can be incredibly helpful if you just need a simple button to click to wake up a machine on your network.

Docker containers will normally use a docker network, which is a separate network from the host network. This means that the container will not be able to send the magic packet to the host network. Therefore, we need to create the container with the `--network host` option, which will allow the container to send the magic packet to the host network (not the docker network).

Create the container as follows;

```bash
user@host: docker create -u root --network=host --name olivetin_wol -v /etc/OliveTin/:/config ghcr.io/olivetin/olivetin:latest
```

Create your OliveTin `config.yaml` file in the `/etc/OliveTin/` directory on the host, with the following content;

```yaml
include::config.yaml[]
```

Obviously adjust the config file with your own MAC addressses, creating new actions to send WOL commands as needed.

Then start the container with the following command;

```
docker start olivetin_wol
```

Then visit your OliveTin web interface at http://yourServer:1337 and you should see something that looks like this;
