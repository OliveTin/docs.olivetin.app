[#jwt]
=== JWT Authorization

One of the best ways to do authorization with OliveTin is to pass it a **JSON Web token (JWT)**, after first authenticating with a popular single sign on system, like Keycloak, CloudFlare Tunnels, Authentik or Organizr.

Two types of JWT mechanisms are supported;

* **<<jwt-keys,JWT with Keys>>** (eg: CloudFlare Tunnels, Authentik)
** X509 Certs/Keys on disk are supported
** **JWKS** is also supported
* **<<jwt-hmac,JWT with HMAC>>** (eg: Organizr)
