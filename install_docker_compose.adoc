[#install-compose]
=== Docker Compose install

Docker compose is a popular way to define multi-container applications using a 
infrastructure as code approach. 

If you personally prefer to use `docker compose`, then here is a sample to get
you started;

[source,yaml]
.`docker-compose.yml`
----
version: "3.8"
services:
  olivetin:
    container_name: olivetin
    image: jamesread/olivetin
    volumes:
      - /docker/OliveTin:/config # replace host path or volume as needed
    ports: 
      - "1337:1337"
    restart: unless-stopped

networks:
  web: # should match the network defined under the container's networks section
      external: true

==== Controlling other docker containers from a Docker Compose install of OliveTin

If you want to use OliveTin running in a container to control other Docker containers, you will need to pass through the Docker sock in your compose file. 

You will need to adjust your docker-compose file to include the docker socket, like this;

 `docker-compose.yml` including docker socket
----
version: "3.8"
services:
  olivetin:
    container_name: olivetin
    image: jamesread/olivetin
    volumes:
      - /docker/OliveTin:/config # replace host path or volume as needed
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock 
    ...
----

You will probably need to tell this container to run as root as well, to control docker (see below).

==== Controlling the docker user with Docker Compose

This is the correct way to tell the OliveTin container to run as root (or any other user);

----
version: "3.8"
services:
  olivetin:
    container_name: olivetin
    image: jamesread/olivetin
    user: root 
    ...
----

NOTE: <<no-puid-pgid,PUID and PGID are not used>> by the official OliveTin container image.

[#docker-compose-traefik]
==== Using Traefik with Docker Compose 

Traefik is a popular reverse proxy that seems to be used a lot in people's
Docker compose setups. See the <<traefik-docker-compose,Traefik + Docker Compose>> page for more details.
