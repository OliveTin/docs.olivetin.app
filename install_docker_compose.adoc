=== Installation using Docker Compose

Docker compose is a popular way to define multi-container applications using a 
infrastructure as code approach. 

If you personally prefer to use `docker compose`, then here is a sample to get
you started;

.`docker-compose.yml`
----
version: "3.8"
services:
  olivetin:
    container_name: olivetin
    image: jamesread/olivetin
    volumes:
      - /docker/olivetin:/config # replace host path or volume as needed
    ports: 
      - "1337:1337"
    restart: unless-stopped

networks:
  web: # should match the network defined under the container's networks
  section
      external: true

==== Using Traefik with Docker Compose (and HTTPS)

Traefik is a popular reverse proxy that seems to be used a lot in people's
Docker compose setups.  

Adjust the `docker-compose.yml` example above to include the following labels;

----
...
    labels:
      - traefik.http.routers.olivetin.rule=Host(`run.your.domain`)
      - traefik.http.routers.olivetin.tls.certresolver=lets-encrypt
...
