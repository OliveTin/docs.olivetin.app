=== Installation using Docker Compose

Docker compose is a popular way to define multi-container applications using a 
infrastructure as code approach. 

If you personally prefer to use `docker compose`, then here is a sample to get
you started;

.`docker-compose.yml`
----
version: "3.8"
services:
  olivetin:
    container_name: olivetin
    image: jamesread/olivetin
    volumes:
      - /docker/olivetin:/config # replace host path or volume as needed
    ports: 
      - "1337:1337"
    restart: unless-stopped
