=== Recommended: Linux package install (.rpm/.deb)

Running OliveTin as a systemd service on a Linux machine means it can use any program installed on your machine (you don't have to add programs to a container). This is generally easier to use than a container, but containers can work just fine too with a bit more effort.

==== Choosing the right Linux package

There are .deb, .rpm, and similar packages published for OliveTin on each
release page. Pick a package most relevant to the Linux distribution you are
using from the link:https://github.com/jamesread/OliveTin/releases[downloads page].

If you're not sure which package to use, see <<choose-package,which download do I need?>>

You can install these packages with your Linux package manager (eg, 
`dpkg -i OliveTin...deb` or `rpm -U OliveTin...rpm`).
