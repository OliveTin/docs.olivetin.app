== Dashboards

OliveTin generates a default view of actions which is useful for simple OliveTin use cases - this is always called "Actions" and cannot be renamed. The Actions view also does not support entities, fieldsets or folders.

If you want to start organizing OliveTin actions more effectively, then **Dashboards** are for you!
