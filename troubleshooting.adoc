=== Exit code 127

Exit code 127 on Linux typically means "command not found". This can be the
case when you need to install command in a container image for example.

=== PUID and PGID support

The OliveTin container image does not use the PUID and PGID convention to specify which user the container should run as - this is a convention that was popularized by linuxserver.io, because their container images use supervisord. Instead, simply use the `--user` argument when defining the container, to change the user OliveTin runs as.
