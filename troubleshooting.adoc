=== Exit code 127

Exit code 127 on Linux typically means "command not found". This can be the
case when you need to install command in a container image for example.

[#no-puid-pgid]
=== PUID and PGID support

The OliveTin container image does not use the PUID and PGID convention to specify which user the container should run as - this is a convention that was popularized by linuxserver.io, because their container images use supervisord. Instead, simply use the `--user` argument when defining the container, to change the user OliveTin runs as.

* link:https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/understanding-puid-and-pgid[LSIO documentation for PUID and PGID, that says that `--user` is the same thing]

An example is shown below;

.Using --user
----
user@host: docker create --name olivetin -p 1337:1337 -v /etc/OliveTin/:/config:ro docker.io/jamesread/olivetin --user container:container
user@host: docker start olivetin
----

The following are common errors;

[#err-fetch-buttons]
=== Error Getting Buttons

This is most often caused by not being able to get to /api/ properly - normally due to a bad proxy config, or your network was disconnected.

[#err-fetch-webiu-settings]
=== Error Fetching WebUI Settings

This is a less common issue, but it means that the main web HTML has loaded, but it could not get http://yourserver:1337/webUiSettings.json - most likely because of a 404 (Not Found) or JSON parse issue. You can see the exact reason if your browser as Web Developer Tools - look in the console. Firefox and Chrome both have great web developer tools, that can normally be opened with the F12 key, or from the developer tools menu.

The most common cause of this issue is a broken reverse proxy configuration. To debug this, browse to http://yourserver:1337/webUiSettings.json and adjust your reverse proxy configuration until the file loads properly. See <<reverse-proxies>> for common configuration instructions.

An uncommon cause of this issue is if you are self-hosting the HTML outside of OliveTin. This is supported, but it means you will need to write the webUiSettings.json file manually. This is currently not documented as very very few people really need or want to do this. It's very uncommon at the moment to self host the HTML outside of the OliveTin main server. Jump on the discord to discuss this if you want to do this, see <<support>>. 

The 

[#err-js-modules-not-supported]
=== Error: JS Modules not supported

This is most likely because you are using a very old browser, or have some Javascript disabled.

This page describes the compatible browsers for Javascript modules; https://caniuse.com/es6-module .

There is no workaround for this apart from updating your browser / using a better browser, as OliveTin wants to be a progressive web app and doesn't intend to support browsers without module support.
