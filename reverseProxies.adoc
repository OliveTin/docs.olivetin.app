== Reverse Proxies

This section of the documentation has a few examples of reverse proxy configurations for popular reverse proxy servers.

=== Haproxy - DNS based

This is a straightforward example of how to setup a DNS name based HAProxy setup for OliveTin.

----
frontend cleartext_frontend
    mode http
    bind 0.0.0.0:80

    option httplog

    use_backend be_olivetin if { hdr(Host) -i olivetin.example.com }

backend be_olivetin
    server olivetinServer 192.168.0.1:1337 check

----

=== Nginx - Path based

nginx.conf
----
....
        location /OliveTin/ {
                proxy_pass http://localhost:1337/;
                proxy_redirect http://localhost:1337/ http://localhost/OliveTin/;
        }
....
----

Note, because you are changing the default path (from `/` to `/OliveTin/`), you will need to tell the OliveTin webUI where to find the API. 

You need to also set `externalRestAddress` in your config.yaml like this;

.OliveTin config.yaml
----
externalRestAddress: http://myserver/OliveTin
actions:
....
