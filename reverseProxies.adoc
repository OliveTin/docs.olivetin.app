Please see the <<docker-compose-traefik,traefik section, in the docker compose installation instructions>> for details.

[#nginx-path]
=== Nginx - Path based

.nginx.conf
----
....
        location /OliveTin/ {
                proxy_pass http://localhost:1337/;
                proxy_redirect http://localhost:1337/ http://localhost/OliveTin/;
        }
....
----

Note, because you are changing the default path (from `/` to `/OliveTin/`), you will need to tell the OliveTin webUI where to find the API. 

You need to also set `externalRestAddress` in your config.yaml like this;

.OliveTin config.yaml
----
externalRestAddress: http://myserver/OliveTin
actions:
....
