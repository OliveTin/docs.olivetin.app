OliveTin is frequently used to create simple container control panels, this is one of the default examples that ships with the standard OliveTin config.yaml.

==== Entity file

To build this Container Control dashboard, we use an <<entities,entity>> file that stores and updates produced by `docker ps --format json > /etc/OliveTin/entities/containers.json`

[source,yaml]
.`/etc/OliveTin/entities/containers.json`

You can generate this file yourself the first time, but the `config.yaml` below shows how OliveTin can run the `docker ps` command on startup, and on a schedule to update the file.

==== Configuration

Then use the following configuration file;

[source,yaml]
.`config.yaml`
