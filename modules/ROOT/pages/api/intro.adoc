= API Overview 
This section of the documentation is intended for developers, and those who want to hack around with OliveTin and extend it. This page provides a few pointers to get started. 

**Short version**: 

* http://olivetinServer:1337/api on your OliveTin server to get the REST API. 
* link:http://docs.olivetin.app/api/swagger/[Swagger] documents the API.

**Longer version**: The OliveTin API is formally defined using the Protobuf IDL, which generates gRPC stubs, as well as a REST Gateway. 

The REST API gateway is used by the WebUI, and you can use it too by default - it is exposed at "/api" by default.

The gRPC API only listens on localhost default, but it can be set to listen publicly. See xref:reference/network-ports.adoc[the network ports documentation] for a better description of how the APIs are exposed. Most people do not need to use the gRPC API.

Please do talk to the developers on Discord if you'd like help using the API, or you're thinking about building something interesting using the API!
