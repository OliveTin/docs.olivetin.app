= API Method: StartActionByGet

This is the method that allows you to specify the action ID in the URL, and is probably the best to do quick integrations - QR Codes, streamdeck, etc. You cannot pass arguments using this method. 

* **HTTP Method**: `GET`
* **Request Type**: Action ID in the URL
* **Response Type**: Execution Tracking ID

== Example API call; Start an action by ID in the URL

.curl
----
user@host: curl http://olivetin.example.com/api/StartActionByGet/pingGithub
----

The corresponding config.yaml would look like this;

[source,yaml]
----
actions:
  - title: Ping GitHub.com
    id: pingGithub
    shell: ping github.com -c 1
----

IDs are used by these API calls, as you probably want the interface to display a human-readable title, whereas the API call doesn't want to have spaces or punctuation.
