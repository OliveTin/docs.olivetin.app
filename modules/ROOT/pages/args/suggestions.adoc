= Suggestions

Argument inputs can also have "suggested" values, which can make it quicker to type commonly used options. The way that these are displayed will vary depending on your browser, as they are implemented as a modern HTML5 browser feature called "datalist".

Suggestions are configured like this;

[source,yaml]
.Configuration example of input suggestions
----
actions:
  - title: Restart Docker Container
    icon: restart
    shell: docker restart {{ container }}
    arguments:
      - name: container
        title: Container name
        suggestions:
          - plex:
          - graefik:
          - grafana:
          - wifi-controller: WiFi Controller
          - firewall-controller: Firewall Controller
----

In the examples above, there are 5 suggestions. The first 3 suggestions contain a suggestion with a blank title. The last 2 suggestions contain a human readable title (eg: `wifi-controller` is the suggestion, and `WiFi Controller` is the title).

NOTE: `suggestions:` is a yaml **map**, not a **list**. If you leave the title empty you must still end the suggestion with a ":".

== Browser Support

`datalist` is widely supported now-a-days, but Firefox on Android notably lacks support; https://caniuse.com/datalist . See the upstream bug here; https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1535985 .
