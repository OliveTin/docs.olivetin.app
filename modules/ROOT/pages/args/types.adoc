|===
| Type                        | Rendered as                       | Allowed values
| (default)                   | xref:args/input.adoc[Textbox]           | If a `type:` is not set, and `choices:` is empty, then ascii will be used, and a warning will be logged. It is recommended that you set the type explicitly, rather than relying on defaults.
| ascii                       | xref:args/input.adoc[Textbox]           | a-z (case insensitive), 0-9, but no spaces or punctuation
| ascii_identifier            | xref:args/input.adoc[Textbox]           | Like a DNS name, a-Z (case insensitive), 0-9, `-`, `.`, and `_`. 
| ascii_sentence              | xref:args/input.adoc[Textbox]           | a-z (case insensitive), 0-9, with spaces, `.` and `,`. 
| unicode_identifier          | xref:args/input.adoc[Textbox]           | Like an ascii identifier, but allows unicode characters. This is useful for languages that use non-ascii characters, such as Chinese, Japanese, etc.
| email                       | xref:args/input.adoc[Textbox]           | An email address.
| password                    | xref:args/password.adoc[Password]       | A password, which is hidden when typed.
| very_dangerous_raw_string   | xref:args/input.adoc[Textbox]           | Anything. This is **incredibly dangerous**, as effectively people can type anything they like, including executing additional commands beyond what you specify. Absolutely should not be used unless your OliveTin instance can only be used by people you trust entirely.
| regex:...                   | xref:args/input.adoc[Textbox]           | Version 2024.03.081 and above support custom regex patterns. See xref:args/regex.adoc[Custom regex arguments].
| int                         | xref:args/input.adoc[Textbox]           | Any number, made up of the characters 0 to 9. Negative numbers are not supported.
| url                         | xref:args/input.adoc[Textbox]           | A url, e.g. https://github.com/OliveTin
| confirmation                | xref:args/input_confirmation.adoc[Confirmation] | A "hidden" argument that makes the action require a confirmation before launching.
| n/a, but `choices` used     | xref:args/input_dropdown.adoc[Dropdown]         | A "hidden" argument that makes the action require a confirmation before launching.
| raw_string_multiline        | xref:args/input_textarea.adoc[Textarea]         | Anything. This is **dangerous**, as effectively people can type anything they like
