[#arg-textbox]
= Input: Textbox

Many times you need to customize how an action/shell command is run, with arguments. For example;

----
echo "Hello world"
----

In the example above, `Hello world` is an argument passed to the `echo` command. OliveTin allows you to add pre-defined, and free-text arguments to commands in this way. Below is the OliveTin version of the `echo` command shown above;

[source,yaml]
.`config.yaml`
----
actions:
  - title: echo a message
    icon: smile
    shell: echo {{ message }}
    arguments:
      - name: message
        default: Hello World
        type: ascii_sentence

actions:
  - title: Print a message
    shell: echo {{ message }}
    arguments:
      - name: message
        description: The message you want to print out on the shell.
        title: Your Message
        default: Hello World
        type: ascii_sentence
----

This will give you a normal button, like this;

However, when you click on it, you'll get a prompt to enter arguments, like this;

You'll see that the type is set to `ascii_sentence`. This applies fairly safe
input validation to arguments, so that only a-z, 0-9, spaces and .'s are allowed. 

When you start the action, and it's finished, go to the "logs" view to view the output of the command we've just run.
