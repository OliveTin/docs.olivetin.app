[#args]
= Introduction to Arguments

Actions and commands that OliveTin runs, without arguments, are generally quite safe - only that command can be run, without modifications. However, many users need the flexibility to set options on that command - normally called command line arguments. In OliveTin, arguments are defined in a shell commands like `echo {{ message }}`, with a bit of extra configuration.

Examples of valid argument names are `{{ personName }}`, `{{ customer_number }}` and `{{ ISBN11_code }}`. 

* a-z (case insensitive)
* _ is allowed
* numbers are allowed (argument names can also start with numbers)
* all other characters are invalid for argument names.
