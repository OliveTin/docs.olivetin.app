= Environment variables

All arguments are also passed as environment variables as well, which can be very useful when passing several arguments to a script, for example.

[source,yaml]
.`config.yaml`
----
actions:
  - title: Print names of new files
    shell: /opt/newfile.py
    arguments:
      - name: filename
        type: unicode_identifier

      - name: filesizebytes
        type: unicode_identifier

      - name: fileisdir
        type: unicode_identifier

    execOnFileCreatedInDir:
      - /home/user/Downloads/
----

This is an example of a python script using the environment variables;

[source,python]
.`/opt/newfile.py`
----
#!/usr/bin/env python

import os

print(os.environ['OLIVETIN'])
print(os.environ['FILENAME'])
print(os.environ['FILESIZEBYTES'])
print(os.environ['FILEISDIR'])
----

== Notes

. Argument names are converted to uppercase for environment variables, `name: filename` becomes `FILENAME`.
. OliveTin also passes an environment variable called `OLIVETIN` which is always just set to `1`, which allow for scripts to detect if they are being run within OliveTin.
. The environment variables are passed into the execution context which uses a shell (/bin/sh on Linux), so it is also possible to use them with the $ notation in the `shell` line, like this; `shell: echo $FILENAME` for example.
