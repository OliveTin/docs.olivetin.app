=== Execute on startup

OliveTin can execute actions on a startup. 

[source,yaml]
.`config.yaml`
----
actions:
  - title: Say hello
    shell: echo "Hello!"
    execOnStartup: true 
----

[#dnf-startup]
==== Example: Install additional commands into OliveTin

This functionality to execute actions on startup is a very easy way to install additional commands in OliveTin, however it requires running OliveTin as a root user to be able to use `microdnf`;

[source,yaml]
.`config.yaml`
----
actions:
  - title: Install dnsmasq
    shell: microdnf install bind-utils
    execOnStartup: true
----

A more secure method than running DNF as root, is a manual command the temporarily runs as root. To learn more about how to install additional packages into the container in this more secure way, see <<container-dnf,installing extra container packages>>.
