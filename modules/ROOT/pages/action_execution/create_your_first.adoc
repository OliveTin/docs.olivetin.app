[#create-your-first-action]
= Create your first action

This is an example of your very first action. First of all, edit your config.yaml, and enter this YAML markup;

.config.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
actions:
  - title: Say hello
    shell: echo "Hello!"
    icon: smile
----

If OliveTin is running, it should popup on your dashboard like this; 

image::hello-world.png[]

Simply click on the button to execute the shell command. You can expand the executions to view the logs.

== Important considerations

* The action title must be unique. If you have multiple actions with the same title, only one will be shown.

== What do I try next?
