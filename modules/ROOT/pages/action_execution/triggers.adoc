=== Triggers

Sometimes you want to trigger another action after the first one completes. This is mostly useful for updating hidden actions that update entity files, without having to run those updates on a cron job every 10 seconds!

[source,yaml]

entities:
  - file: /etc/OliveTin/entities/containers.json
    name: container

actions:
  - title: stop {{ container.Names }}
    shell: docker stop {{ container.Names}}
    entity: container
    trigger: update containers

  - title: update containers
    shell: docker ps -a --format=json > /etc/OliveTin/entities/containers.json
    hidden: true
