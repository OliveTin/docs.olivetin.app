=== Rate limiting

By default, OliveTin allows you to execute actions as fast as you can click the button. This is fine if you are running OliveTin with trusted users in a trusted environment, but otherwise you may want to rate limit actions.

Rate limiting is implemented like this;

[source,yaml]
.`config.yaml`
----
actions:
  - title: date
    shell: date
    icon: clock
    maxRate:
      - limit: 3
        duration: 5m
----

If you try to execute `date` more than 3 times in 5 minutes, you will get a log message that looks like this;

----
INFO Blocked from executing. This action has run 3 out of 3 allowed times in the last 5m.  actionTitle="date"
----
