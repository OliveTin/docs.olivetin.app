[#timeout]
= Timeouts

By default, actions in OliveTin have a **3 second timeout** for all actions.
This means that OliveTin will kill the action if it is running for longer than
the timeout, which can be useful to stop commands running for a long time.

You can set your own timeouts like this;

[source,yaml]
----
actions:
  - title: My special action
    shell: sleep 5
    timeout: 10
----

NOTE: Allowing commands to run for infinity just doesn't seem to make sense, or
at least is probably a bad case for OliveTin. Therefore, if you set a timeout
*less than 3 seconds*, OliveTin will overwrite your Timeout and default to 3
seconds. If you think you have a use case where a shorter (or infinite) timeout
makes sense, please open an issue and let's discuss.

== Check the logs

If a action really does "time out", it will show in the logs with "(timed out)" next to the exist code;
