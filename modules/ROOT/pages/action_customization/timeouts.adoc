=== Timeouts

By default, actions in OliveTin have a 3 second timeout. This means that
OliveTin will kill the action if it is running for too long. 

You can set your own timeouts like this;

----
- actions:
  - title: My special action
    shell: sleep 5
    timeout: 10
----

NOTE: Allowing commands to run for infinity just doesn't seem to make sense, or
at least is probably a bad case for OliveTin. Therefore, if you set a timeout
*less than 3 seconds*, OliveTin will overwrite your Timeout and default to 3
seconds. If you think you have a use case where a shorter (or infinite) timeout
makes sense, please open an issue and let's discuss.

==== Check the logs

If a action really does "time out", it will show in the logs with "(timed out)" next to the exist code;
