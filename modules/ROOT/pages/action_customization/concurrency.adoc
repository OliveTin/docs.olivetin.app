=== Concurrency

By default, OliveTin will allow you to run several instances of an action at the same time. For example, an action might take 20 seconds, and if you click the button 3 times, for a time there will be 3 actions running at the same time.

Sometimes you don't want to allow this - an example case where it would not make sense is in the case of a backup script. To stop this, we can set `maxConcurrent` to `1`. 

[source,yaml]
----
actions:
  - title: Run Backup Script
    icon: backup
    shell: /opt/backupScript.sh
    maxConcurrent: 1
----

If you try and run a 2nd instance of this action while the first is currently running, you'll get a "blocked" message that looks like this;

Additionally, OliveTin will log a message that looks like this;

[source,log]
.OliveTin log showing an action being blocked rom running.
----
INFO Action requested                              actionTitle="Run backup script"
WARN Blocked from executing. This would mean this action is running 2 times concurrently, but this action has maxExecutions set to 1.  actionTitle="Run backup script"
----

Naturally, you can set `maxConcurrent` to `3` or some other number, to limit the amount of times the action executes at once.
