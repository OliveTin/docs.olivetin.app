= Run as different users

OliveTin does not *need* to run as root. It does not request any special
permissions from the operating system that require root (as long as you run on
ports above 1024, and it can read/write it's configuration). So, you can run as
any non-root user if you wish.

However, it is very convenient to run as root, as many users will need to run 
actions and jobs that do require root permissions. 

There are no ways in OliveTin to specify which user runs an action, because the
Linux OS has several great ways to do this already, and adding support for it
in OliveTin just adds bloat when there are perfectly good ways that already
exist.

== EG: Using sudo;

----
actions:
  - title: Run echo as a different user
    shell: sudo -u bob echo "I am Bob."
----

If you are worried about security, you could run OliveTin as a non-privileged
user, and use sudo rules to control what it can and cannot do.
