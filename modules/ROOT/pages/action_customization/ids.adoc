=== IDs

OliveTin actions do not require IDs to be specified in the `config.yaml`, as most users of OliveTin start off with the Web Interface. However, if you want to use OliveTin actions via the <<api,API>>, then you will need to set your action IDs manually.

NOTE: OliveTin will automatically generate a new ID for actions every time it starts up, for actions that don't have an `id:` property set.
