= Action customisation

Actions in OliveTin can be customized in many ways to fit your specific needs. This section covers various customization options that allow you to control how actions behave, appear, and execute.

You can customize actions by:

* Setting icons to make actions visually distinct
* Configuring timeouts to control how long actions can run
* Assigning actions to specific users or groups
* Controlling concurrency to limit how many instances of an action can run simultaneously
* Setting rate limits to prevent actions from being executed too frequently
* Using enabled expressions to dynamically enable/disable actions based on entity state
* Assigning unique IDs for API access
* Configuring log saving for audit trails
* Setting popup behaviors when actions start

See the links in this section for detailed information on each customization option.
