= Error: WebUI Version Mismatch

This is most often caused by the WebUI Version not matching the server version. On every release of OliveTin, these versions should match.

There are cache-busting mechanisms built into OliveTin to try and avoid this error, but they don't always work in every environment.

This most often happens when the the proxy or web browser is aggressively caching the WebUI files. Try forcing a refresh with "Ctrl+F5" in your browser. If that doesn't work, try clearing your browser cache.
