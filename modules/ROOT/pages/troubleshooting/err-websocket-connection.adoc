[#err-websocket-connection]
=== Error Connecting to WebSocket

If OliveTin was working, but this error popped up, it's most likely because your reverse proxy closed the connection due to a timeout.

If OliveTin is always displaying this error, it's probably your reverse proxy not handling the websocket properly. Please check the Reverse Proxy documentation for more information.
