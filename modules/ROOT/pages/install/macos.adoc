= MacOS

Sorry that these instructions are so primitive, the main developer of OliveTin's MacOS machine died :-( If you can help with instructions and screenshots that would be great.

This is a .tar.gz that you can download, extract.

Start a terminal and CD into the OliveTin directory.

Run OliveTin by doing `./OliveTin`.
