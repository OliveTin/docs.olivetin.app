[#install-helm]
= Kubernetes with Helm

Helm makes installing OliveTin on Kubernetes very easy, the official chart is hosted on Artifact Hub. 

https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?repo=olivetin[image:https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://artifacthub.io/badge/repository/olivetin[Artifact Hub]]

== Requirements

=== Prerequisites

* [x] A Kubernetes cluster setup and running
* [x] Kubernetes client installed and authenticated
* [x] An ingress controller configure for web traffic
* [x] Helm installed and authenticated to the cluster

== Installation

[source,shell]
----
user@host: helm repo add olivetin https://olivetin.github.io/OliveTin-HelmChart/
user@host: helm install olivetin olivetin/olivetin
NAME: olivetin
LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Apr  1 23:19:09 2025
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
----

== Configure

After a minute or two, check the pod status;

[source,shell]
----
user@host: kubectl get pods
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
olivetin-578b79766-4b8lg   1/1     Running   0          87s
----

Hopefully the pod is not crashlooping or anything like that. If it is, check the logs.

The helm chart should have created a basic ConfigMap for you;

[source,shell]
----
user@host: kubectl describe cm/olivetin-config
Name:         olivetin-config
Namespace:    default
Labels:       app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm
Annotations:  meta.helm.sh/release-name: olivetin
              meta.helm.sh/release-namespace: default

Data
====
config.yaml:
--
actions:
  - title: "Hello world!"
    shell: echo 'Hello World!'

----

You should edit this ConfigMap to match your needs for OliveTin. Remember to restart the OliveTin deployment if you want the config changes to be picked up more quickly; 

[source,shell]
----
user@host: kubectl rollout restart deploy/olivetin
deployment.apps/olivetin restarted
----
