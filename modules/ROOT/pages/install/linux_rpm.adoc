[#install-linuxpackage]
= Generic .rpm based Linux

Running OliveTin as a systemd service on a Linux machine means it can use any program installed on your machine (you don't have to add programs to a container). This is generally easier to use than a container, but containers can work just fine too with a bit more effort.

There are .rpm packages published for OliveTin on each release page. If you distribution is not linked in this installation guide, and you use a .rpm based Linux distribution, this package should work.

You can install these packages for .rpm like this;

[source,bash]
....
user@host: rpm -U https://github.com/OliveTin/OliveTin/releases/latest/download/OliveTin_linux_amd64.rpm
