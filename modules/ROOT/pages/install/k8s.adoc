[#install-k8s]
= Kubernetes with Manifest files

OliveTin works just fine on Kubernetes. The easiest way to deploy it is with a
Kubernetes `ConfigMap`, `Deployment`, `Service` and finally `Ingress`. Like so; 

== ConfigMap
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$k8s_configmap.yml[]
----

The main application config.yml for OliveTin is specified in the `ConfigMap`
above. You will want to edit this later - see the "Configuration" section. 

Next, we need a deployment;

== Deployment
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$k8s_deployment.yml[]
----

That should deploy OliveTin. 

== Service

Now that OliveTin is deployed, expose it's port as a service;

[source]
----
user@host: kubectl expose deployment/olivetin
----

Lastly, create a Ingress rule for for that service;

== Ingress
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$k8s_ingress.yml[]
----

include::partial$install/to_config.adoc[]
