[#args]
== Arguments 

=== Introduction to Arguments

Actions and commands that OliveTin runs, without arguments, are generally quite safe - only that command can be run, without modifications. However, many users need the flexibility to set options on that command - normally called command line arguments. In OliveTin, arguments are defined in a shell commands like `echo {{ message }}`, with a bit of extra configuration.

Examples of valid argument names are `{{ personName }}`, `{{ customer_number }}` and `{{ ISBN11_code }}`. 

* a-z (case insensitive)
* _ is allowed
* numbers are allowed (argument names can also start with numbers)
* all other characters are invalid for argument names.

=== Important Safety Warning

Before you continue, it's important to read through this safety warning. 

OliveTin supports customization of command line arguments, but there is a element of risk. For example, if your command is `echo {{ message }}`, and you allow your users to set `{{ message }}` to the value `"" && rm -rf /` , then you've got real problems. For this reason, OliveTin tries to give you useful ways to restrict what users are allowed to enter - with **argument types**. 

However, here are some important rules to try and follow with argument types;

* Use the most restrictive argument types when possible - `ascii` and `int`. This will stop users entering argument values that might be used dangerously, but it's not foolproof. For example, if you have a command like `createSnapshot.sh --count {{ snapshotCount }}`, and set `snapshotCount` to `int`, then at least users will only be able to enter integer numbers. However, nothing stops them entering crazy values like 9999. 
* Don't give access to actions with arguments to people you don't trust. Please don't ever put your OliveTin install on the public internet! 

[#arg-types]
=== Argument types

A full list of argument types are below;

.Argument types reference table
[%header,cols="1,0,2"]
|===
| Type                        | Rendered as                       | Allowed values
| (default)                   | <<arg-textbox,Textbox>>           | If a `type:` is not set, and `choices:` is empty, then ascii will be used, and a warning will be logged. It is recommended that you set the type explicitly, rather than relying on defaults.
| ascii                       | <<arg-textbox,Textbox>>           | a-z (case insensitive), 0-9, but no spaces or punctuation
| ascii_identifier            | <<arg-textbox,Textbox>>           | Like a DNS name, a-Z (case insensitive), 0-9, `-`, `.`, and `_`. 
| ascii_sentence              | <<arg-textbox,Textbox>>           | a-z (case insensitive), 0-9, with spaces, `.` and `,`. 
| email                       | <<arg-textbox,Textbox>>           | An email address.
| very_dangerous_raw_string   | <<arg-textbox,Textbox>>           | Anything. This is **incredibly dangerous**, as effectively people can type anything they like, including executing additional commands beyond what you specify. Absolutely should not be used unless your OliveTin instance can only be used by people you trust entirely.
| regex:...                   | <<arg-textbox,Textbox>>           | Version 2024.03.081 and above support custom regex patterns. See <<args-custom-regex,Custom regex arguments>>. 
| int                         | <<arg-textbox,Textbox>>           | Any number, made up of the characters 0 to 9. Negative numbers are not supported.
| url                         | <<arg-textbox,Textbox>>           | A url, e.g. https://github.com/OliveTin
| confirmation                | <<confirmation,Confirmation>> | A "hidden" argument that makes the action require a confirmation before launching. See <<confirmation,confirmation arguments>>.
| n/a, but `choices` used     | <<arg-dropdowns,Dropdown>>         | A "hidden" argument that makes the action require a confirmation before launching.
| raw_string_multiline        | <<arg-textarea,Textarea>>         | Anything. This is **dangerous**, as effectively people can type anything they like
|===

[#arg-textbox]
=== Input: Textbox

Many times you need to customize how an action/shell command is run, with arguments. For example;

----
echo "Hello world"
----

In the example above, `Hello world` is an argument passed to the `echo` command. OliveTin allows you to add pre-defined, and free-text arguments to commands in this way. Below is the OliveTin version of the `echo` command shown above;

[source,yaml]
.`config.yaml`
----
actions:
  - title: echo a message
    icon: smile
    shell: echo {{ message }}
    arguments:
      - name: message
        default: Hello World
        type: ascii_sentence

actions:
  - title: Print a message
    shell: echo {{ message }}
    arguments:
      - name: message
        description: The message you want to print out on the shell.
        title: Your Message
        default: Hello World
        type: ascii_sentence
----

This will give you a normal button, like this;

image::args1.png[]

However, when you click on it, you'll get a prompt to enter arguments, like this;

image::args2.png[]

You'll see that the type is set to `ascii_sentence`. This applies fairly safe
input validation to arguments, so that only a-z, 0-9, spaces and .'s are allowed. 

When you start the action, and it's finished, go to the "logs" view to view the output of the command we've just run.

[#args-custom-regex]
=== Custom regex

OliveTin version 2024.02.081 and above support custom regex patterns for argument types. Here is an example to validate against any 3 letter word;

NOTE: The regex pattern should be enclosed in single quotes, otherwise you will probably get a YAML error when starting OliveTin.

[source,yaml]
.`config.yaml`
----
actions:
  - title: echo a message
    icon: smile
    shell: echo "{{ message }}"
    arguments:
      - name: message
        type: 'regex:^\w\w\w$'
----

The site http://regex101.com is a good place to test your regex patterns.



[#arg-suggestions]
=== Suggestions

Argument inputs can also have "suggested" values, which can make it quicker to type commonly used options. The way that these are displayed will vary depending on your browser, as they are implemented as a modern HTML5 browser feature called "datalist".

Suggestions are configured like this;

[source,yaml]
.Configuration example of input suggestions
----
actions:
  - title: Restart Docker Container
    icon: restart
    shell: docker restart {{ container }}
    arguments:
      - name: container
        title: Container name
        suggestions:
          - plex:
          - graefik:
          - grafana:
          - wifi-controller: WiFi Controller
          - firewall-controller: Firewall Controller
----

In the examples above, there are 5 suggestions. The first 3 suggestions contain a suggestion with a blank title. The last 2 suggestions contain a human readable title (eg: `wifi-controller` is the suggestion, and `WiFi Controller` is the title).

NOTE: `suggestions:` is a yaml **map**, not a **list**. If you leave the title empty you must still end the suggestion with a ":".

==== Examples

==== Browser Support

`datalist` is widely supported now-a-days, but Firefox on Android notably lacks support; https://caniuse.com/datalist . See the upstream bug here; https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1535985 .

[#arg-dropdowns]
=== Input: Dropdowns

Predefined choices are normally the safest type of arguments, because users are limited to only enter values that you specify. 

[source,yaml]
----
actions:
  - title: echo a message
    icon: smile
    shell: echo "{{ message }}"
    arguments:
      - name: message
        choices:
          - title: Hello
            value: Hello there!

          - title: Goodbye
            value: Aww, goodbye. :-( 
----

Note that when predefined choices are used, the argument type is ignored.

This is what it looks like in the web interface;

image::args4.png[]

Then finally, when you execute this command, it would look something like this (remember that this is just a basic "echo" command). 

image::args-choices-exec.png[]

[#args-dropdown-entities]
==== Using Entities in Dropdowns

Dropdowns can also be populated with a list of entities, like this;

[source,yaml]
.`config.yaml`
----
actions:
  - title: restart container
    shell: 'docker restart {{ containerToRestart }}'
    arguments:
      - name: containerToRestart
        entity: container
        title: 'Select Container'
        choices:
          - value: '{{ container.Names }}'
            title: '{{ container.Names }}'

entities:
  - file: entities/containers.json
    name: container
----

This is what it looks like in the web interface;

image::args-choices-entities.png[]

[#confirmation]
=== Input: Confirmation

The `confirmation` type argument is a special argument type, which simply disables the "Start" button until a checkbox is ticked. This can be useful if you have an action with no other arguments, but you want to prevent accidental button-clicks starting the action.

[source,yaml]
----
actions:
  - title: Delete old backups
    icon: ashtonished
    shell: rm -rf /opt/oldBackups/
    arguments:
      - type: confirmation
        title: Are you sure?!
----

image::action-confirmation.png[]

Notice in the webui the "start" button is disabled.

[#arg-datetime]
=== Input: DateTime

OliveTin supports datetime pickers - note that these do NOT add your timezone, so it up to your scripts / commands to interpret which timezone is being used.

[source,yaml]
.`config.yaml`
----
actions:
  - title: Print your favourite datetime!
    shell: echo {{ my_favourite_time }}
    arguments:
      - type: datetime
        title: My Favourite DateTime
----

image::arg-datetime.png[]

[NOTE]
====
The OliveTin server does try to parse and validate the date on the server side to prevent dangerous input, but there is no validation in the browser, beyond what your browser might do to prevent you from picking an invalid date. +

**This is safe**, as what really matters is what the server allows to be passed to be executed - and that is checked.
====

[#arg-textarea]
=== Input: Textarea

OliveTin supports multi-line text inputs, which can be useful for longer messages or scripts. You should set your argument `type` to `raw_string_multiline` to use these.

As the name implies, textareas are raw, and are NOT validated by any regex.

[#env-vars]
=== Environment variables

All arguments are also passed as environment variables as well, which can be very useful when passing several arguments to a script, for example.

[source,yaml]
.`config.yaml`
----
actions:
  - title: Print names of new files
    shell: /opt/newfile.py
    arguments:
      - name: filename
        type: unicode_identifier

      - name: filesizebytes
        type: unicode_identifier

      - name: fileisdir
        type: unicode_identifier

    execOnFileCreatedInDir:
      - /home/user/Downloads/
----

This is an example of a python script using the environment variables;

[source,python]
.`/opt/newfile.py`
----
#!/usr/bin/env python

import os

print(os.environ['OLIVETIN'])
print(os.environ['FILENAME'])
print(os.environ['FILESIZEBYTES'])
print(os.environ['FILEISDIR'])
----

==== Notes

. Argument names are converted to uppercase for environment variables, `name: filename` becomes `FILENAME`.
. OliveTin also passes an environment variable called `OLIVETIN` which is always just set to `1`, which allow for scripts to detect if they are being run within OliveTin.
. The environment variables are passed into the execution context which uses a shell (/bin/sh on Linux), so it is also possible to use them with the $ notation in the `shell` line, like this; `shell: echo $FILENAME` for example.
