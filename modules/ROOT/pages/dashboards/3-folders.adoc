=== Folders (Directories)

Folders (Directories) are a good way to group up actions in the same way that you would
organize files on your computer into directories.

You must first create a dashboard to use a directory, and then you "reference" actions that you
want in that folder based on the action name. Anything without a "contents" property is treated
as an action.

Let's look at the example below with 4 actions, 2 top level folders and 1 subfolder.

.`config.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
actions:
  - title: Action 1
    shell: echo "action1"

  - title: Action 2
    shell: echo "action2"

  - title: Action 3
    shell: echo "action3"

  - title: Action 4
    shell: echo "action4"

dashboards:
  - title: My First Dashboard
    contents:
      - title: Fieldset 1
        type: fieldset
        contents:
          - title: Folder 1
            contents:
              - title: Action 1
              - title: Action 2

              - title: Subfolder 2
                contents:
                  - title: Action 3

          - title: Folder 2
            contents:
              - title: Action 4
