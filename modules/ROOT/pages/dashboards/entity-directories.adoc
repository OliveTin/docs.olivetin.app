= Entity Directories

Entity directories are a way of grouping actions together based on a single entity instance.

For example, if you have a `server` entity, you can create a directory called `servers` and then add all the actions that you want to apply to all servers to that directory.

In the default config, **More Options** is an **entity directory** because it's parent is a fieldset that is defined with an `entity` property.
