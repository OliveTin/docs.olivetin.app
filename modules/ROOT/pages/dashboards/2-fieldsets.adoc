=== Fieldsets

It is possible to group actions together in a "group", which is not a directory, but is called
a "fieldset". This is an example of a fieldset that contains two xref:dashboards/3-folders.adoc[Folders].

Fieldsets are defined under a xref:dashboards/intro.adoc[Dashboards] in your config.yaml.

.`config.yaml`
[source,yaml]

dashboards:
  - title: My First Dashboard
    contents:
      - title: Fieldset 1
        type: fieldset
        contents: []

      - title: Fieldset 2
        type: fieldset
        contents: []

Fieldsets are also generated for you when you use xref:entities/intro.adoc[Entities].

.`config.yaml`
[source,yaml]
