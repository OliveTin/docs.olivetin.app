=== Most recent action output

This is considered an advanced and experimental feature at the moment.

The `stdout-most-recent-execution` view is a way to display the most recent output of an action on a dashboard. This is useful for actions that are run on a schedule, or actions that are run on startup. This is a picture of what it looks like:

To set this up, here is the configuration you need to add to your `config.yaml` file;

[source,yaml]
----
actions:
  - title: Get status
    id: status_command
    shell: date
    execOnStartup: true
    execOnCron:
      - "*/1 * * * *"

dashboards:
  - title: Control Panel
    contents:
      - title: Status
        type: fieldset
        contents:
          - type: stdout-most-recent-execution
            title: status_command
----

Note that the output only refreshes with the browser, not when the button is clicked. 

As this is an experimental feature, please look at options for xref:troubleshooting/wheretofindhelp.adoc[support] if you need help getting it to work.
