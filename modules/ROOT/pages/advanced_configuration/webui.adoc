[#customize-webui]
= Customize the web UI

The OliveTin web UI is reasonably customizable - parts of the page that you don't need can be hidden when they're not needed. 

== Page Title

You can customize the page title;

image::page-title.png[]

.`config.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
pageTitle: My OliveTin Instance
----

[#show-nav]
== Navigation - show / hide

You can choose to hide the navigation elements in OliveTin, to present a simplified user interface.

.The default user interface with the sidebar shown

To have OliveTin hide these buttons, add `showNavigation: false` to your config.yaml;

.`config.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
logLevel: "INFO"
showNavigation: false

actions:
    ....
----

.The same user interface, but with the sidebar hidden (`showNavigation: false`)

[#section-navgiation-style]
== Section Navigation Style

`sectionNavigationStyle` - You can choose to have the section navigation buttons displayed as a Sidebar (`sidebar` - default), or along the top (`topbar`).

=== Sidebar navigation style (default)

`sectionNavigationStyle: sidebar` looks like this;

image::sidebar.png[]

=== Topbar navigation style

`sectionNavigationStyle: topbar` looks like this;

image::topbar.png[]

[#show-new-versions]
== New version available - show/hide

You can disable the "new version" information in the footer - the default for `showNewVersions` is `true`; 

.`config.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
logLevel: "INFO"
showNewVersions: false
----

OliveTin does not check for updates by default. To enable it, see xref:reference/updateChecks.adoc[enable update checking].


[#show-footer]
== Footer visibility - show / hide

You can disable the entire footer, if you would like a really minimal interface. The default for `showFooter` is `true`.

.`config.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
logLevel: "INFO"
showFooter: false
----

This means the <<show-new-versions,`showNewVersions`>> configuration option will automatically be `false` as well.

== Additional section navigation links

You can add custom links to the OliveTin navigation bar. This is useful if you want to link to other OliveTin instances, or other web applications.

[source,yaml]
----
additionalNavigationLinks:
  - title: Duck Duck Go
    url: https://duckduckgo.com
    target: _blank
----

This will render like this;

[#custom-js]
== Custom JavaScript

This is considered an advanced feature, and is not recommended unless you like writing your own code.

You can add custom JavaScript to OliveTin, which will be executed on every page load. This can be useful for adding custom functionality to the web UI.

1. The custom javascript should be in a file called `custom.js` and saved in `custom-webui/`, which should be in the same directory as your `config.yaml`.
2. You can put whatever code you like really in your `custom.js` file. 
3. Set `enableCustomJs: true` in your `config.yaml` to enable this feature.
4. Restart OliveTin. Note that the custom JavaScript will only be loaded once on startup, so if you are changing the custom JavaScript while OliveTin is running, you will need to restart OliveTin to see the changes.

== Custom CSS (with a custom theme)

You can customize OliveTin with themes, but it's also possible to write your on very simple theme that contains just a few CSS rules to change the look and feel of OliveTin. This is very useful if you just want to change the colours of OliveTin, or hide a few elements.

=== Writing a simple theme with a CSS change

You'll need to create a new theme, and let's assume our theme name is going to be called `uihack`. OliveTin themes are simply a directory of CSS and other assets. OliveTin looks for a directory called `custom-webui/themes/<theme-folder-name>` in the same directory as your `config.yaml` file. 

Start by creating a directory called `custom-webui/themes/uihack` relative to the same directory as your `config.yaml` file. In this directory, create a file called `theme.css`.

[source,yaml]
----
├── config.yaml
└── custom-webui
    └── themes
        └── uihack
            └── theme.css
----

Here's an example of what your `theme.css` should contain;

```css
body {
	background-color: red;
}
```

=== Setup OliveTin config to use your theme

Now you need to tell OliveTin to use your new theme. To do this, set `themeName: uihack` in your OliveTin config.yaml and restart OliveTin.

```yaml
logLevel: "INFO"
themeName: uihack
```

[WARNING]
OliveTin will by default only read theme.css once on startup. If you are intending to change theme.css while OliveTin is running, set `themeCacheDisabled: true` in your config.yaml. This will make OliveTin read theme.css on every request, and is useful for development.

Restart OliveTin for the theme change to take effect. Beware of the theme cache mentioned above, if you are making changes to the CCS and refreshing the page a few times.
