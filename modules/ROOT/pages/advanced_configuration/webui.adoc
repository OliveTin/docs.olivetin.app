[#customize-webui]
= Customize the web UI

The OliveTin web UI is reasonably customizable - parts of the page that you don't need can be hidden when they're not needed. 

== Page Title

You can customize the page title;

image::page-title.png[]

.`config.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
pageTitle: My OliveTin Instance
----

[#show-nav]
== Show Navigation 

You can choose to hide the navigation elements in OliveTin, to present a simplified user interface.

.The default user interface with the "Actions" and "Settings" buttons shown.

To have OliveTin hide these buttons, add `showNavigation: false` to your config.yaml;

.`config.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
logLevel: "INFO"
showNavigation: false

actions:
    ....
----

.The same user interface, but with the "Actions" and "Settings" buttons hidden (`showNavigation: false`)

[#section-navgiation-style]
== Section Navigation Style

`sectionNavigationStyle` - You can choose to have the section navigation buttons displayed as a Sidebar (`sidebar` - default), or along the top (`topbar`).

[#custom-js]
== Custom JavaScript

This is considered an advanced feature, and is not recommended unless you like writing your own code.

You can add custom JavaScript to OliveTin, which will be executed on every page load. This can be useful for adding custom functionality to the web UI.

The custom javascript should be in a file called `custom.js` and saved in `custom-webui/`, which should be in the same directory as your `config.yaml`.

You will need to set `enableCustomJs` to `true` in your `config.yaml` to enable this feature.

[#show-new-versions]
== Show new versions

You can disable the "new version" information in the footer - the default for `showNewVersions` is `true`; 

.`config.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
logLevel: "INFO"
showNewVersions: false
----

OliveTin does not check for updates by default. To enable it, see xref:reference/updateChecks.adoc[enable update checking].

[#show-footer]
== Show the footer 

You can disable the entire footer, if you would like a really minimal interface. The default for `showFooter` is `true`.

.`config.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
logLevel: "INFO"
showFooter: false
----

This means the <<show-new-versions,`showNewVersions`>> configuration option will automatically be `false` as well.
