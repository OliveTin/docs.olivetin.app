= Diagnostics

OliveTin provides a built-in diagnostics page that can be used to help check how OliveTin is running and help to troubleshoot issues. It's mainly designed for checking SSH configuration at the moment.

This is a screenshot of the diagnostics page, which can be accessed by clicking the "Diagnostics" link in the navigation bar:
