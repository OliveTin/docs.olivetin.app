= Logs Calendar View

The logs calendar view provides a visual way to browse your action execution history. Instead of scrolling through a list of logs, you can see executions displayed on a calendar, making it easy to identify patterns, busy periods, or specific dates when actions were run.

== Accessing the Calendar View

To access the calendar view, navigate to the **Logs** page and click the **Calendar** button in the toolbar. This will switch from the list view to the calendar view.

You can return to the list view at any time by clicking the **Back to list** button.

== Features

=== View Executions on a Calendar

Each action execution is displayed as an event on the calendar. Events show:

* The action title
* The action icon (if configured)

This gives you a quick visual overview of when actions were executed throughout the month.

=== Navigate Between Months

Use the navigation controls at the top of the calendar to move between months. The calendar will display all logged executions for the visible month.

=== Click on an Event

Click on any event (execution) on the calendar to view the full execution details, including:

* The complete output of the action
* Execution timing information
* Exit code and status
* User who triggered the action

=== Click on a Date

Click on any date on the calendar to filter the logs list view by that specific day. This is useful when you want to see all executions from a particular date in the traditional list format.

After clicking a date, you'll be redirected to the logs list view with a date filter applied. You can clear this filter using the clear button next to the timestamp header.

== Use Cases

The calendar view is particularly useful for:

* **Auditing** - Quickly identify when specific actions were run
* **Troubleshooting** - Find executions around a specific date when issues occurred
* **Pattern recognition** - Visualize how often scheduled actions run
* **Historical review** - Get an overview of system activity over time
