= Configuration

OliveTin is controlled by a `config.yaml` file. On startup, it looks for this
file in the following locations; 

1. The value specified by the `--configdir` argument, which defaults to the current working directory (`./`)
2. `/config/` - Mostly used for containers
3. `/etc/OliveTin/` - this is the recommended directory on Linux for your `config.yaml`. 

The most simple `config.yaml` would be something like this;

.The most simple `config.yaml` file.
[source,yaml]
----
actions:
  - title: "Hello world!"
    shell: echo 'Hello World!'
----

The configuration does not really get more complicated than that. You can of course add more actions, and customize more, but the syntax otherwise extremely simple. 

For building up from here, look at the following resources; 

* See the xref:action_examples/intro.adoc[action examples] section for extra examples of what OliveTin could be configured to do.

* See the xref:action_customization/intro.adoc[action customization] documentation to customize how those actions work.

* See the xref:solutions/intro.adoc[Solutions] documentation for just the essential configuration to achieve popular use cases.

All configuration options are covered in the sollution sections
