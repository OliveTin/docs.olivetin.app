This is an example of how to setup a DNS name based Apache HTTPD proxy for OliveTin. It assumes OliveTin is running on localhost, port 1337.

./etc/httpd/conf.d/OliveTin.conf
[source,apache]
----
<VirtualHost *:80>
ServerName olivetin.example.com
ProxyPass / http://localhost:1337/
ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:1337/

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/websocket
RewriteRule /(.) ws://localhost:1337/websocket [P,L]
</VirtualHost>
----

Note, you virtual host should *not* include a DocumentRoot directive - httpd is just proxying OliveTin, not serving it's actual pages.
