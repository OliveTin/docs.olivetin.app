=== Security

OliveTin should be reasonably secure. Here are some security considerations in
the design of the app; 

. Admins have full control over what commands can by run using `config.yaml`. OliveTin does NOT write to the config.yaml in any way.
. OliveTin listens on just 1 open public port by default (1337). The rest of the ports only listen on `localhost` so you don't have to worry about them in your firewall.
. Standard Linux controls can be used to run OliveTin as non-root, with `sudo` permissions if needed. See the action customization section of these docs for more details.
