=== Themes (for users)

You can look for themes on the link:http://www.olivetin.app/themes/[OliveTin Theme Site].

==== Installing a theme

There are 3 ways to install a theme;

1. Use the `olivetin-get-theme` command to easily Git clone the theme into your `custom-webui/themes/` directory.
2. Download the theme .zip and copy it across to your `custom-webui/themes/` directory.
3. Git Clone the theme into your `custom-webui/themes/` directory.

==== How to use the `olivetin-get-theme` command

The default OliveTin configuration comes with an action to get new OliveTin themes. If you deleted it from your configuration, you can add it back in by adding the following to your `config.yaml` file;

[source,bash]
----
actions:
  - title: Get OliveTin Theme
    shell: olivetin-get-theme {{ themeGitRepo }} {{ themeFolderName }}
    icon: theme
    arguments:
      - name: themeGitRepo
        title: Theme's Git Repository
        description: Find new themes at https://olivetin.app/themes
        type: url

      - name: themeFolderName
        title: Theme's Folder Name
        type: ascii_identifier
----

When you are browsing the OliveTin Theme Site, you can click on a theme and see it's Git Repository URL. You can then copy this URL and paste it into the `olivetin-get-theme` command.

==== Where do I find my themes directory?

When OliveTin starts up, it will try to create a directory called `custom-webui/themes/` in your config directory. This directory is where you can put your own custom themes.

OliveTin will then serve this theme directory at `http://yourserver:1337/custom-webui/themes/`, this means that all theme content should go into `/custom-webui/themes/mytheme/`.

Install Themes into your `custom-webui/themes/` directory, which should be in your config directory. If this directory does not exist, you can create it.

[source,yaml]
----
├── config.yaml
├── custom-webui
│   └── themes
│       └── custom-icons
│           ├── icon.png
│           └── theme.css
├── entities
│   ├── containers.json
│   ├── heating.yaml
│   ├── servers2.yml
│   ├── servers.yaml
│   └── systemd_units.json
└── installation-id.txt
----

==== Create your own theme (without any intention of publishing it)

Create a sub-directory under your theme directory (eg `custom-webui/themes/mytheme`);

Set your theme in your config

[source,yaml]
.`config.yaml`
----
themeName: mytheme
----

Add your css into `custom-webui/themes/mytheme/theme.css`.

Your theme css will be loaded "on top" of the existing stylesheet.

To test it is working, set your theme CSS to something ridiculous like;

----
body {
    background-color: red !important;
}
----

Profit.
