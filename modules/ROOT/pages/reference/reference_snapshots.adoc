=== Snapshot builds

It's sometimes useful to test code changes in OliveTin that are still in development - and have not yet made it into an official version, yet. Thankfully, all code changes are automatically compiled into a "snapshot" builds and are saved in GitHub actions.

If you browse to GitHub actions page for OliveTin, you'll find the "Build Snapshot" job, with a list of recent builds.

Most of the time you will want to select the top build, unless you've specifically been given a build link to use. 

==== Download the snapshot archive

On the job page, you will have a single "snapshot" file listed. In this screenshot, it is 109 MB.

Once downloaded, you can open the archive using any tool that you use to open .zip files. The contents should read something like this;

Extract the file you need, and off you go!
