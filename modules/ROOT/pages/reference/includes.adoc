= Includes

OliveTin 3k supports including configuration files from other files. This is useful for organizing large configurations or reusing common settings across multiple actions.

== Include Syntax

To include another configuration file, use the following syntax in your main configuration file:

[source,yaml]
----	
include: config.d
----

This will include all config files in the <config dir>/config.d/ directory.
