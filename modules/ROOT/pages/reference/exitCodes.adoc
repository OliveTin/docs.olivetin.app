= Understanding exit codes

OliveTin just runs commands. If the command exits with an unusual exit code
(something other than 0), OliveTin will tell you. Many Linux commands will exit
with code 1, 2, 3, etc to indicate different types of errors.

It's important to understand that OliveTin is just reporting back what the
command exited with, it's very unusual for OliveTin to cause new types of
errors!

For example, if `ping` exits with code 1 or 2, the documentation for ping says
that this indicates either a name not found, timeout, or other similar error.
The best thing you can do is `man ping` to read the ping manual page to find
out more.

== Common error codes

* **Exit code 127** is used by the Linux shell to indicate "Command not found". Most often this means you need to install the command (often in the linux container image).
