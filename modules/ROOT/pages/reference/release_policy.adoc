= Release Policy 

This page is a collection of notes around the policy for releases.

== Package and tag deletions

The OliveTin project *WILL* delete packages and tags in the following situations;

* A release went out accidently, or the package is broken in a way that prevents installation or use (something critical).
* A release went out with the wrong tag, or wrong tag format (eg 2025-11-06 instead of 2025.11.06) for OliveTin 2k.
 * This is because registries that contain bag tag formats that do not match smever will cause issues for users trying to install or upgrade in the future.

It is understood that this can break some users workflows, but deleting packages occours rarely, and is only done to prevent further issues.

If this is really a concern that you want to guard against, it is recommended to run your own private registry/mirror of OliveTin packages.

Deleted packages will not be supported in any way;
