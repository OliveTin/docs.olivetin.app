=== Concepts

OliveTin only has 1 method for doing **Authentication** (ie: entering a username and password -- see xref:security/local.adoc[Local Users] ), however it can do **Authorization** (ie: checking permissions of a user who logged in via another system, like single sign on) in many number of ways.

OliveTin supports the following methods of Authorization:

- xref:security/trusted_header.adoc[Trusted Header] (eg: Nginx, Apache, etc)
- xref:security/jwt.adoc[JWT] (eg: Traefik, Organizr, etc)
- xref:security/oauth2.adoc[OAuth2] (eg: Google, GitHub, etc)
