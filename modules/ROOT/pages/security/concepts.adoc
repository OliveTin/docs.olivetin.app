= Security Concepts

OliveTin implements a security model that covers **Authentication**, **Authorization** (via xref:security/acl.adoc[ACLs]) and **Accounting**.

== Authentication

To allow users to be Authenticated to OliveTin, there are several options to choose from;

- xref:security/local.adoc[Local Users] (ie: Login with Username and Password)
- xref:security/oauth2.adoc[OAuth2] (eg: Google, GitHub, etc)
- xref:security/trusted_header.adoc[Trusted Header] (eg: Nginx, Apache, etc)
- xref:security/jwt.adoc[JWT] (eg: Traefik, Organizr, etc)

== Authorization

OliveTin's authorization system, or permissions, is built on xref:security/acl.adoc[Access Control Lists]. This is a powerful mechanism that allows you to implement very fine grained access control, or your own role based access control (RBAC).

== Accounting

OliveTin's accounting is via it's logs. This aspect of OliveTin's security model is poorly documented at the moment.
