[#jwt-hmac]
= JWT with HMAC

You need to know your JWT **Cookie Name** and **Hash Secret**. Whatever tool you are using to authenticate users will probably have instructions on how to find this.

 Adding JWT details to OliveTin config.yaml

Setup your config file so it has something like this;

[source,yaml]
.`config.yaml`
----
# It's often useful to turn logging to DEBUG when trying to work out authentication problems
logLevel: "INFO"

authJwtCookieName: "Organizr_token_1234..."
authJwtHmacSecret: "3l4jh23v_123!"
authJwtClaimUsername: "username"
authJwtClaimUsergroup: "usergroup"
----

Note that your `authJwtCookieName` and `authJwtSecret` will need to be set exactly as they appear in your Authentication software.

== Usable claims

OliveTin currently can match Access Control Lists based on a **username** or **primary user group**. These must be called `name` and `group` respectively. You can see if these are being used properly turning on `DEBUG` logging and looking at the jwt claims.

== Setup default permissions

OliveTin will assume that guests are able to View and Execute every action by default. When you are setting up authorization you probably want to limit this. You can do that by setting `defaultPermissions` like this;

[source,yaml]
.`config.yaml`
----
logLevel: "INFO"

defaultPermissions:
    view: false
    exec: false
----

== Setup OliveTin Access Control Lists 

Access Control Lists are a way to override the default permissions.

[source,yaml]
.`config.yaml`
----
logLevel: "INFO"

defaultPermissions:
    view: false
    exec: false
    logs: true

accessControlLists:
    - name: Admins
      addToEveryAction: true
      matchUsergroups: 
      - Admins
      permissions:
        view: true
        exec: true
        logs: true

    - name: "Developers"
      matchUsergroups:
      - "developer"
      permissions:
        view: true
        exec: false
        logs: false

actions:
    - name: Only visible to admins
      shell: echo "I am a secret command only visible to admins"

    - name: Restart database
      shell: systemctl restart mariadb
      acls:
        - "developer"
----

In the example above, the `admins` ACL is automatically added to every action, because `addToEveryAction` is true. 

 Customizing field names

You may need to customize the field names for your JWT authentication. 

[source,yaml]
.`config.yaml`
----
authJwtClaimUsername: "username"
authJwtClaimUsergroup: "usergroup"
----
