=== OAuth2 - Authentik

OliveTin has been tested with Authentik. This documentation page describes how to configure Authentik for use with OliveTin and assumes you already have Authentik installed and running.

Login as an Authentik administrator and start by creating a new app as follows;

Submit this wizard to save the configuration.

==== OliveTin configuration

The necessary OliveTin configuration is as follows;

```yaml
authOAuth2RedirectURL: "http://localhost:1337/oauth/callback"
authOAuth2Providers:
  authentik:
    name: authentik
    title: Authentik
    clientID: "1234567890"
    clientSecret: "123456789012345"
    authURL: "http://localhost:9000/application/o/authorize/"
    tokenURL: "http://localhost:9000/application/o/token/"
    whoamiURL: "http://localhost:9000/application/o/userinfo/"
    usernameField: "preferred_username"
    icon: <iconify-icon icon="simple-icons:authentik"></iconify-icon>
```

You will need to restart OliveTin for the changes to take effect.

==== Testing

You should now be able to login to OliveTin using Authentik, on the OliveTin page, a "Login" link should be available in the top right corner. This will take you to the login form, where you can select the Authentik provider.


=== Debugging

OliveTin logs OAuth2 flows quite extensively. If you are having trouble with OAuth2, you should check your OliveTin logs.
