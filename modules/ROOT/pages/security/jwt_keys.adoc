== Using Public Keys via JWKS

OliveTin Supports **JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS)**. This approach is often used with services like CloudFlare.

[source,yaml]
.`config.yaml`
----
authJwtAud: "asdf1234"
authJwtCertsURL: "https://mydomain.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/certs"
authJwtClaimUsername: email
authJwtCookieName: "CF_Authorization"
----

You may well want to set `logLevel: DEBUG` and `insecureAllowDumpJwtClaims: true` in your config when testing JWT for the first time.

== Using Public Keys on Disk

This approach can be useful if your Authentication service does not support JWKS, or if you don't want to use it. Public Keys should be available on disk in a file - which can have any filename or extension you like. The files need to be RSA keys in PEM format to be used by OliveTin, though. P12 is not supported.

[source,yaml]
.`config.yaml`
----
authJwtAud: "asdf1234"
authJwtPubKeyPath: "/opt/mykey.crt"
authJwtClaimUsername: email
authJwtCookieName: "CF_Authorization"
----
