=== Local Users Login

include::../snippit_earlydoc.adoc[]

OliveTin supports just basic users defined with a username and password in the config.yaml file. This can be used when you do not want to use a full authentication system like LDAP, OAuth2 or a Reverse Proxy.

==== Define a user

.`config.yaml`
```yaml
authLocalUsers:
  enabled: true
  users:
    - username: james
      password: $argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=4,p=6$LnNW4sw+jZfa5Ex3YjfuHQ$vl8pjUJhxNmBxScV4lI3cgAZPkNB1rSrnX6ibgoAP8k
```

==== Define users with a user group

OliveTin local users do not need to be part of a user group, and unless any user groups are added, they will not be in any user group. However, if you want to add a user to a user group, you can do so like this:

```yaml
authLocalUsers:
  enabled: true
  users:
    - username: alice
      usergroup: admins
      password: $argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=4,p=6$LnNW4sw+jZfa5Ex3YjfuHQ$vl8pjUJhxNmBxScV4lI3cgAZPkNB1rSrnX6ibgoAP8k

    - username: bob
      password: ...
      usergroup: admins

    - username: charlie
      password: ...
      usergroup: webmasters
```

==== Get a Argon2id hashed password

Argon2id is the recommended password hashing algorithm link:https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html[recommebded by OWASP] as of October 2024. There doesn't seem to be a good reason yet to provide configuration options for changing the password hashing algorithm, but if you have a good reason, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.

===== Option A - Using OliveTin API

You can see from the example above that the config contains a single user called *james*, and the password is hashed using Argon2id. OliveTin provides a utility API to hash passwords using Argon2id which can be useful when you want to create new users. Simply run the following curl command to hash a password:

```bash
curl -sS --json '{"password": "myPassword"}' http://olivetin.example.com:1337/api/PasswordHash
```

NOTE: Curl 7.82 added support for the `--json` option, if you are using an older version of curl, see link:https://github.com/OliveTin/OliveTin/issues/462[this issue].

This will return a output like this, you can then copy and paste this hash into your config.yaml file;

```
Your password hash is: $argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=4,p=6$dlWTV1RL04/Nuvxzl94NAg$KsYXvCFE2Eu/jkXi/dbbZM3I/2b2VByTAwRIenUwdJk
```

===== Option B - Using the `argon2` command line tool

You can also easily hash the password using the `argon2` package:

```bash
echo -n "myPassword" | argon2 "$(openssl rand -base64 16)" -id -t 4 -m 16 -p 6 -l 32 -e
```

===== Opption C - Using the `hash` docker image
Or using the link:https://hub.docker.com/r/leplusorg/hash[hash] docker image:

```bash
docker run --rm -i --net=none leplusorg/hash sh -c 'echo -n "myPassword" | argon2 "$(openssl rand -base64 16)" -id -t 4 -m 16 -p 6 -l 32 -e'
```

Then simply visit the OliveTin web interface and browse to the login page, eg: http://olivetin.example.com:1337/login

==== Force login page

If you don't want to allow guests to do anything in OliveTin, you can use the `authRequireGuestsToLogin` option to force all users to login before they do anything. This will redirect all users to the login page if they are not logged in, and it will also set `defaultPermissions` to `false`, meaning that permissions must be explicitly set for each user or user group.

.`config.yaml`
```yaml

authRequireGuestsToLogin: true

authLocalUsers:
  enabled: true
  users:
    - username: james
      password: $argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=4,p=6$LnNW4sw+jZfa5Ex3YjfuHQ$vl8pjUJhxNmBxScV4lI3cgAZPkNB1rSrnX6ibgoAP8k
```
