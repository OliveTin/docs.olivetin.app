=== GitOps (run actions on Git Push) ===

A really helpful thing to do with OliveTin is to have it run actions when you push to a Git repository. This is a great way to automate things like running tests, building your project, or deploying your code - this turns OliveTin into a powerful GitOps tool, or even a Continuous Integration tool.

This guide assumes that you are using a self-hosted Git repository, and uses a standard Git `post-receive` hook to trigger OliveTin actions. If you are using a hosted Git service like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, you will need to check their documentation for how to trigger actions on push.

To set up OliveTin to run actions on Git push, you will need to:

1. Create a new OliveTin action that you want to run on push.
2. Set up a Git `post-receive` hook to trigger the OliveTin action.

==== Create a New OliveTin Action ====

First, you will need to create a new OliveTin action that you want to run when you push to your Git repository. This could be anything you like - for example, running tests, building your project, or deploying your code. The example below is a simple action that echoes a message to the console:

[source,yaml]
.OliveTin `config.yaml`
----
actions:
  - title: Run on Git Push
    id: gitops
    icon: <iconify-icon icon="bi:git"></iconify-icon>
    shell: |
        echo "You just pushed commit $COMMIT to git, running action..."
        date
    arguments:
        - name: commit
          type: ascii
----

Note that OliveTin will expose all arguments as environment variables in uppercase as shown in the example above. You can of course use the `{{ commit }}` syntax instead and it will do the same thing.

==== Add a Git hook script ====

The following below assumes that you have a Git repository initialized as a bare repository, at `/opt/myrepo.git`. If you have a different repository location, you will need to adjust the paths accordingly.

First, create a new file at `/opt/myrepo.git/hooks/post-receive` with the following contents:

[source,bash]
.Script: `myrepo.git/hooks/post-receive`
----
#!/bin/bash

read OLDREV NEWREV REFNAME

OLIVETIN_REQUEST="$(cat <<EOF
{
  "actionId": "gitops",
  "arguments": [
    {
      "name": "commit",
      "value": "$NEWREV"
    }
  ]
}
EOF
)"

exec curl -sS --json "$OLIVETIN_REQUEST" http://localhost:1337/api/StartAction
----

Make sure you make the script executable, and edit the last line of the script to point to your OliveTin instance.

[source,bash]
----
chmod +x /opt/myrepo.git/hooks/post-receive
----

Now, whenever you push to your Git repository, the `post-receive` hook will trigger the OliveTin action you created. You can see if the action was triggered by pushing to the git repository, and looking for output like this;

----
remote: {"executionTrackingId":"55c7371d-7a67-42a4-87d8-d5677b878186"}
----

This is the `executionTrackingId` of the action that was triggered. You can use this to track the progress of the action in the OliveTin UI.
