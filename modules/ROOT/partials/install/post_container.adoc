== Post installation (container)

You will need to write a basic configuration file before OliveTin will startup.

Create a basic config file at `/etc/OliveTin/config.yaml` - the exact path depends on what directory you specified in the bind mount container creation in the last step. Note that the file must be called `config.yaml`, and `config.yml` or `mystuff.yaml` would not work. You can download a sample configuration file like this if you like;

[source,shell]
.Download the sample config.yaml file to get you started.
----
user@host: cd /etc/OliveTin/
user@host: curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OliveTin/OliveTin/main/config.yaml
----

The file contents should look something like this;

.The most simple `config.yaml` file.
[source,yaml]
----
actions:
  - title: "Hello world!"
    shell: echo 'Hello World!'
----

If you are running a firewall on your server, like firewalld, you will need to
open port 1337;

== Configure your firewall

== Start the OliveTin service

Now that you have a configuration file, and the OliveTin container created, you are now ready to start OliveTin!

user@host: docker start olivetin

== Troubleshooting podman/docker installations

If you are having problems in starting OliveTin, or OliveTin is crashing on startup, then check the logs like this;
