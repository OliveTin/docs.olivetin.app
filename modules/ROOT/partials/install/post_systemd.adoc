== Post installation

You will need to write a basic configuration file before OliveTin will startup.

Create the following basic config file at `/etc/OliveTin/config.yaml` with the
following contents;

.The most simple `config.yaml` file.
[source,yaml]
----
actions:
  - title: "Hello world!"
    shell: echo 'Hello World!'
----

Now that you have a configuration file, and OliveTin is installed, start it;

.Start the service (only needed once)
[source,shell]
----
user@host: systemctl enable --now OliveTin 
----

If you are running a firewall on your server, like firewalld, you will need to
open port 1337;

[source,shell]
----
user@host: firewall-cmd --add-port 1337/tcp --permanent
user@host: firewall-cmd --reload
----

== Troubleshooting systemd installations

If you are having problems, you can check if OliveTin is running like this; 

[source,shell]
----
user@host: systemctl status OliveTin
----

If the service has failed, scroll through the logs;

[source,shell]
----
user@host: journalctl -eu OliveTin
----
