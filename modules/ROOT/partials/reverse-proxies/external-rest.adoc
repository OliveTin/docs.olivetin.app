Note, because you are changing the default path (from `/` to `/OliveTin/`), you will need to tell the OliveTin webUI where to find the API. 

You need to also set `externalRestAddress` in your config.yaml like this;

.OliveTin config.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
externalRestAddress: http://myserver/OliveTin
----
