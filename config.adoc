[#config]
== Configuration

OliveTin is controlled by a `config.yaml` file. On startup, it looks for this
file in the following locations; 

1. The value specified by the `--configdir` argument, which defaults to the current working directory (`./`)
2. `/config/` - Mostly used for containers
3. `/etc/OliveTin/` - this is the recommended directory on Linux for your `config.yaml`. 

The most simple `config.yaml` would be something like this;

.The most simple `config.yaml` file.
[source,yaml]
----
actions:
  - title: "Hello world!"
    shell: echo 'Hello World!'
----

It doens't really get more complicated than that. You can of course add more actions, and customize more, but the syntax otherwise extremely simple. 

For building up from here, look at the following resources; 

* See the <<actions,actions>> documentation for extra examples of what OliveTin could be configured to do.

* See the <<action-customisation,action cutomisation>> documentation to customize how those actions work.

=== Show/Hide web UI elements

The OliveTin web UI is reasonably customizable - parts of the page that you don't need can be hidden when they're not needed. 

[#show-nav]
==== Show Navigation 

You can choose to hide the navigation elements in OliveTin, to present a simplified user interface.

To have OliveTin hide these buttons, add `hideNavigation` to your config.yaml;

.`config.yaml`
----
logLevel: "INFO"
showNavigation: false

actions:
    ....
----

.The same user interface, but with the "Actions" and "Settings" buttons hidden (`hideNavigation: true`)

[#show-new-versions]
==== Show new versions

You can disable the "new version" information in the footer - the default for `showNewVersions` is `true`; 

.`config.yaml`
----
logLevel: "INFO"
showNewVersions: false
----

If disabled, OliveTin will still check for new versions in the background, but will not display them on the page. If you want to disable update checking completely, see <<disable-update-checks,disable update checking>>.

[#show-footer]
==== Show the footer 

You can disable the entire footer, if you would like a really minimal interface. The default for `showFooter` is `true`.

.`config.yaml`
----
logLevel: "INFO"
showFooter: false
----

This means the <<show-new-versions,`showNewVersions`>> configuration option will automatically be `false` as well.

[#log-levels]
=== Log Levels
OliveTin supports a few different log levels. The default logLevel is `INFO`. 

You can set a `logLevel` in config.yaml like this;

----
logLevel: "INFO"

actions:
    ....
----

The supported log levels are;

* `DEBUG` - Every possible log message will be shown. This will use a lot of disk space and is not recommended unless you are a developer / like reading code.
* `ERROR` - OliveTin rarely uses the `ERROR` log level.
* `WARN` - Very few messages, only warnings are shown.
* `INFO` - The defualt log level.

You can change the `logLevel` while OliveTin is running, and it should update as soon as you save your config.yaml.You will always get a log message like this;

----
INFO[0787] Setting log level to warning
----
