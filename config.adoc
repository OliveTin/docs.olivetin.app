[#config]
== Configuration

OliveTin is controlled by a `config.yaml` file. On startup, it looks for this
file in the following locations; 

1. The current working directory (`./`)
2. `/config/` - Mostly used for containers
3. `/etc/OliveTin/` - this is the recommended directory on Linux for your
`config.yaml`. 

The most simple `config.yaml` would be something like this;

.The most simple `config.yaml` file.
[source,yaml]
----
actions:
  - title: "Hello world!"
    shell: echo 'Hello World!'
----

It doens't really get more complicated than that. You can of course add more actions, and customize more, but the syntax otherwise extremely simple. 

For building up from here, look at the following resources; 

* See the <<actions,actions>> documentation for extra examples of what OliveTin could be configured to do.

* See the <<action-customisation,action cutomisation>> documentation to customize how those actions work.

[#hide-nav]
=== Hide Navigation 

You can choose to hide the navigation elements in OliveTin, to present a simplified user interface.

To have OliveTin hide these buttons, add `hideNavigation` to your config.yaml;

----
logLevel: "INFO"
hideNavigation: true

actions:
    ....
----

[#log-levels]
=== Log Levels
OliveTin supports a few different log levels. The default logLevel is `INFO`. 

You can set a `logLevel` in config.yaml like this;

----
logLevel: "INFO"

actions:
    ....
----

The supported log levels are;

* `DEBUG` - Every possible log message will be shown. This will use a lot of disk space and is not recommended unless you are a developer / like reading code.
* `ERROR` - OliveTin rarely uses the `ERROR` log level.
* `WARN` - Very few messages, only warnings are shown.
* `INFO` - The defualt log level.

You can change the `logLevel` while OliveTin is running, and it should update as soon as you save your config.yaml.You will always get a log message like this;
