=== Arch Linux (AUR)

There are two packages available for Arch Linux;

* link:https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/olivetin[`olivetin`] - This builds from source, using a release Git tag.This is officially maintained by the authors of the OliveTin project.
* link:https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/olivetin-bin[`olivetin-bin`] - This re-packages the binaries built by the official binaries. This is not officially maintained by the authors of the OliveTin project, and might be a bit older - but it should work just fine.
