== Advanced Configuration

This section includes optional configuration options that are used less frequently by most users.

[#customize-webui]
=== Customize the web UI

The OliveTin web UI is reasonably customizable - parts of the page that you don't need can be hidden when they're not needed. 

==== Page Title

You can customize the page title;

image::images/page-title.png[]

.`config.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
pageTitle: My OliveTin Instance
----

[#show-nav]
==== Show Navigation 

You can choose to hide the navigation elements in OliveTin, to present a simplified user interface.

.The default user interface with the "Actions" and "Settings" buttons shown.

To have OliveTin hide these buttons, add `showNavigation: false` to your config.yaml;

.`config.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
logLevel: "INFO"
showNavigation: false

actions:
    ....
----

.The same user interface, but with the "Actions" and "Settings" buttons hidden (`showNavigation: false`)

[#show-new-versions]
==== Show new versions

You can disable the "new version" information in the footer - the default for `showNewVersions` is `true`; 

.`config.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
logLevel: "INFO"
showNewVersions: false
----

If disabled, OliveTin will still check for new versions in the background, but will not display them on the page. If you want to disable update checking completely, see <<disable-update-checks,disable update checking>>.

[#show-footer]
==== Show the footer 

You can disable the entire footer, if you would like a really minimal interface. The default for `showFooter` is `true`.

.`config.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
logLevel: "INFO"
showFooter: false
----

This means the <<show-new-versions,`showNewVersions`>> configuration option will automatically be `false` as well.

[#log-levels]
=== Log Levels
OliveTin supports a few different log levels. The default logLevel is `INFO`. 

You can set a `logLevel` in config.yaml like this;

.`config.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
logLevel: "INFO"

actions:
    ....
----

The supported log levels are;

* `DEBUG` - Every possible log message will be shown. This will use a lot of disk space and is not recommended unless you are a developer / like reading code.
* `ERROR` - OliveTin rarely uses the `ERROR` log level.
* `WARN` - Very few messages, only warnings are shown.
* `INFO` - The defualt log level.

You can change the `logLevel` while OliveTin is running, and it should update as soon as you save your config.yaml. You will always get a log message like this;

[source,bash]
----
INFO Setting log level to warning
----


[#ports]
=== Ports

See <<network-ports,the network ports>> documentation in the reference section.

[#timezone]
=== Timezone

OliveTin will obviously use the system time just like all other programs, but when running in a container, time works in a slightly unusual way. 

You may be used to using a TZ or TIMEZONE environment variable in your Linux container inages, but this is not a standard that works for all Linux distributions - it's mostly supported by Debain based containers. OliveTin's base container image is fedora-minimal, which deliberately does not include timezone data, to reduce storage space. 

To change the time in the OliveTin container, simply bind-mount the correct zone file; 

.Same as the container host
----
docker create -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime -v /etc/OliveTin:/config --name OliveTin docker.io/jamesread/olivetin
----

.Different timezone to the container host
----
docker create -v /usr/share/zoneinfo/Japan:/etc/localtime -v /etc/OliveTin:/config --name OliveTin docker.io/jamesread/olivetin
----

[#prometheus]
=== Prometheus

OliveTin supports basic Prometheus metrics, and the project is interested to hear about what more metrics people would find useful, as well!

To enable Prometheus support;

.`config.yaml`
----
logLevel: INFO

prometheus:
    enabled: true
    defaultGoMetrics: false
----

This will give you metrics, like this;

[source]
----
# HELP olivetin_actions_requested_count The actions requested count
# TYPE olivetin_actions_requested_count gauge
olivetin_actions_requested_count 0
# HELP olivetin_config_action_count Then number of actions in the config file
# TYPE olivetin_config_action_count gauge
olivetin_config_action_count 18
# HELP olivetin_config_reloaded_count The number of times the config has been reloaded
# TYPE olivetin_config_reloaded_count counter
olivetin_config_reloaded_count 1
# HELP olivetin_sv_count The number entries in the sv map
# TYPE olivetin_sv_count gauge
olivetin_sv_count 49
