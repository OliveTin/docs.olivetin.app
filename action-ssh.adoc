=== SSH into another machine and run a command

:systemd: Easy
:container: Needs some setting up - if you are using the default container image you will need to run the command `dnf install openssh-clients` first.

.OliveTin `config.yaml`
[source,shell]
....
actions:
    # This will SSH into a server an run the command 'service httpd restart'
   - title: Restart httpd on Server 1
     shell: ssh root@server1 'service httpd restart'
     icon: ping
     timeout: 5
....

*Note about SSH keys*: You should make sure that the user that OliveTin is running as has access
to a SSH key. There are lots of good articles on the internet that explain how
to setup password-less login with a SSH key. This applies to container images
as well.

==== Setup if running inside a container

image:images/ssh-diagram.png[]

1. The OliveTin container is created with `.ssh` as a volume mount, that contains a SSH Key.
2. OliveTin uses the SSH key to connect back to server1 or across to server2.

===== Setup instructions

On `server`, run generate a SSH key (if you haven't already got one) `ssh-keygen`, and store it in somewhere like `/opt/mySshKeys`; 

----
root@server1: ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): /opt/mySshKeys/id_rsa
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /opt/mySshKeys/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /opt/mySshKeys/id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:t+vGUn+MTeOtRDpxKanO3Cg63+gvAHslZCe3YVNnfWU root@server1
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|         .. o.  E|
|      + *  o  ...|
|     o = +     . |
|    . . o    . . |
|     o oS . + +  |
|    . o  ..o *o  |
|     . . oo.o*.o |
|      . +*o+oo= .|
|      .=+BX .... |
+----[SHA256------+
----

This will create two files, `/opt/mySshKeys/id_rsa` (your private key) and `/opt/mySshKeys/id_rsa.pub` (your public key). 

For every server that you want to use this key on, you need to copy your public key;

----
root@server1: ssh-copy-id root@server1 
(enter password)
root@server2: ssh-copy-id root@server2
(enter password)
----

You will be asked to login with a password for each server.

After you have done that, you will then be able to login with the ssh key instead;

----
root@server1: ssh -i /opt/mySshKeys/id_rsa root@server2
(you should login without a password)
----

Now, we need to give the OliveTin container access to use this key, by passing it into the container with a "volume mount". When you create the container, you use "-v" to specify a volume.

You should mount your SSH keys directory into the OliveTin user's home directory by creating the container like this;

----
docker run -v /opt/mySshKeys/:/home/olivetin/.ssh/ --name OliveTin jamesread/olivetin
----

This also works for things like SSH configuration files, if you want to use them. This is step 1 complete from the diagram above.

Thankfully, step 2 is very simple! `ssh` commands in your OliveTin `config.yaml` should work without a password!, and allow OliveTin to access services, files, and other stuff outside of the OliveTin container.

.OliveTin `config.yaml`
[source,shell]
....
actions:
    # This will SSH into a server an run the command 'service httpd restart'
   - title: Restart httpd on Server 1
     shell: ssh root@server1 'service httpd restart'
     icon: ping
     timeout: 5
....
