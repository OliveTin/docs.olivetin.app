== Action customisation

=== Icons

You can specify any HTML for an icon. It's a popular choice to use Unicode
icons because they are extremely fast to load and there are a lot of them.

.Examples of icons in OliveTin

==== Unicode icons ("emoji")

For example on the link:https://unicode-table.com/en/emoji/[here is a list of
"Eomji" in unicode]. If you find "link:https://unicode-table.com/en/1F60E/[Smiling face with sunglasses]" you can click 
on it to see it's "HTML-code". In OliveTin, you'd setup the icon like this;

----
actions:
  - title: Unicode (emoji) icon
    icon: "&#128526;"
    shell: echo "You are awesome"
----

==== Full HTML icons (`<img src ...`)
You can also specify the full HTML for an image, like;

----
actions:
    - title: HTML (jpg/png/etc) icon
      icon: '<img src = "https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/d8/2019-07/vertical-logo-monochromatic.png" width = "48px"/>'
      shell: docker ps
----

NOTE: This full HTML thing is very customizable, but easier options will
probably be added in the future as well.

=== CSS styles

OliveTin allows you to write any CSS style rules directly on a single action.
This is both pretty powerful if you want an action to have a particular style,
but it does require understanding that you are writing your code - and can
break things! Be careful!

A tutorial on how to use CSS can easily be found online, but here are some
examples;

==== Example: Bold & Purple action

----
- actions:
    - title: My special action
      css:
        background-color: purple
        font-weight: bold
      shell: echo "I like purple"
----
////

=== Timeouts

By default, actions in OliveTin have a 3 second timeout. This means that
OliveTin will kill the action if it is running for too long. 

You can set your own timeouts like this;

----
- actions:
  - title: My special action
    shell: sleep 5
    timeout: 10
----

NOTE: Allowing commands to run for infinity just doesn't seem to make sense, or
at least is probably a bad case for OliveTin. Therefore, if you set a timeout
*less than 3 seconds*, OliveTin will overwrite your Timeout and default to 3
seconds. If you think you have a use case where a shorter (or infinite) timeout
makes sense, please open an issue and let's discuss.

=== Run as different users

OliveTin does not *need* to run as root. It does not request any special
permissions from the operating system that require root (as long as you run on
ports above 1024, and it can read/write it's configuration). So, you can run as
any non-root user if you wish.

However, it is very convenient to run as root, as many users will need to run 
actions and jobs that do require root permissions. 

There are no ways in OliveTin to specify which user runs an action, because the
Linux OS has several great ways to do this already, and adding support for it
in OliveTin just adds bloat when there are perfectly good ways that already
exist.

==== EG: Using sudo;

----
actions:
  - title: Run echo as a different user
    shell: sudo -u bob echo "I am Bob."
----

If you are worried about security, you could run OliveTin as a non-privileged
user, and use sudo rules to control what it can and cannot do.
