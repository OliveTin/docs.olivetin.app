[#auth]
== Authentication & Authorization

See <<auth-concepts,concepts>> for a good overview of how this works in OliveTin. 

[#auth-concepts]
=== Concepts

OliveTin does not have any built-in code for doing **Authentication** (eg: entering a username and password), however it can do **Authorization** by relying on another system like a reverse proxy or "homepage" tool to first login users. OliveTin is often deployed alongside <<reverse-proxies,reverse proxies>> like Traefik and Organizr, which pass a special "token" to OliveTin, so OliveTin knows when a user has been authenticated.

1. User browses to a website like Organizr and logs in, which sets a JWT Cookie for apps.example.com.
2. User browses to OliveTin.apps.example.com, and the cookie is sent to OliveTin.
3. OliveTin verifies the JWT token given the signing secret, and picks up on the `name` and `group` fields from the JWT claim.
4. OliveTin matches any relevant ACLs based on the claims.
5. If any ACLs are not matched, then the defaultPermissions are used.

[#trusted-header]
=== Trusted Header Authorization

This method is not yet well documented, sorry! Ask on Discord - we need more people to test this feature.

----
AuthHttpHeaderUsername "X-Username"
AuthHttpHeaderUsergroup "X-Usergroup"
----

NOTE: You *must* set `AuthHttpHeaderUsername` to some value, even if you only intend to use `AuthHttpHeaderUsergroup`, otherwise usergroups will be ignored.

[#jwt]
=== JWT Authorization

You need to know your JWT **Cookie Name** and **Hash Secret**. Whatever tool you are using to authenticate users will probably have instructions on how to find this.

* link:https://docs.organizr.app/features/server-authentication#validating-the-token[Organizr - Under "Validating the token"]

==== Adding JWT details to OliveTin config.yaml

Setup your config file so it has something like this;

----
# It's often useful to turn logging to DEBUG when trying to work out authentication problems
logLevel: "INFO"

authJwtCookieName: "Organizr_token_1234..."
authJwtSecret: "3l4jh23v_123!"
authJwtClaimUsername: "username"
authJwtClaimUsergroup: "usergroup"
----

Note that your `authJwtCookieName` and `authJwtSecret` will need to be set exactly as they appear in your Authentication software.

==== Usable claims

OliveTin currently can match Access Control Lists based on a **username** or **primary user group**. These must be called `name` and `group` respectively. You can see if these are being used properly turning on `DEBUG` logging and looking at the jwt claims.

==== Setup default permissions

OliveTin will assume that guests are able to View and Execute every action by default. When you are setting up authorization you probably want to limit this. You can do that by setting `defaultPermissions` like this;

----
logLevel: "INFO"

defaultPermissions:
    view: false
    exec: false
----

====  Setup OliveTin Access Control Lists 

Access Control Lists are a way to override the default permissions.

----
logLevel: "INFO"

defaultPermissions:
    view: false
    exec: false

accessControlLists:
    - name: Admins
      addToEveryAction: true
      matchUsergroups: 
      - Admins
      permissions:
        view: true
        exec: true

    - name: "Web Admins"
      matchUsergroups:
      - "webadmin"
      permissions:
        view: true
        exec: false

actions:
    - name: Only visible to admins
      shell: echo "I am a secret command only visible to admins"

    - name: Restart database
      shell: reboot
      acls:
        - "webadmin"
----

In the example above, the `admins` ACL is automatically added to every action, because `addToEveryAction` is true. 

==== Customizing field names

You may need to customize the field names for your JWT authentication. 

----
authJwtClaimUsername: "username"
authJwtClaimUsergroup: "usergroup"
----
