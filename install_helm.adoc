=== Installation on Kubernetes with Helm

Helm makes installing OliveTin on Kubernetes very easy. 

----
user@host: helm repo add olivetin https://olivetin.github.io/OliveTin-HelmChart/
user@host: helm install olivetin olivetin/olivetin
----

You will probably want to `kubectl expose ...` your service afterwards.
