**Use cases**;

1. Give controlled access to run shell commands to less technical folks who cannot be trusted with SSH. I use this so my family can `podman restart plex` without asking me, and without giving them shell access!
2. Great for home automation tablets stuck on walls around your house - I use this to turn Hue lights on and off for example. 
3. Sometimes SSH access isn't possible to a server, or you are feeling too lazy to type a long command you run regularly! I use this to send Wake on Lan commands to servers around my house.

**Features**

* **Responsive, touch-friendly UI** - great for tablets and mobile
* **Super simple config in YAML** - because if it's not YAML now-a-days, it's not "cloud native" :-) 
* **Dark mode** - for those of you that roll that way.
* **Accessible** - passes all the accessibility checks in Firefox, and issues with accessibility are taken seriously.  
* **Container** - available for quickly testing and getting it up and running, great for the selfhosted community. 
* **Integrate with anything** - OliveTin just runs Linux shell commands, so theoretially you could integrate with a bunch of stuff just by using curl, ping, etc. However, writing your own shell scripts is a great way to extend OliveTin.
* **Lightweight on resources** - uses only a few MB of RAM and barely any CPU. Written in Go, with a web interface written as a modern, responsive, Single Page App that uses the REST/gRPC API.
* **Good amount of unit tests and style checks** - helps potential contributors be consistent, and helps with maintainability.
