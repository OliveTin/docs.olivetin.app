=== Security

OliveTin should be reasonably secure. Here are some security considerations in
the design of the app; 

1. Admins have full control over what commands can by run using `config.yaml`. 
2. OliveTin does not accept any action (command) arguments by design at the
moment, as this has huge potential for exploitation and needs to be handled
carefully.
3. OliveTin listens on just 1 open public port by default (1337). The rest of
the ports only listen on `localhost` so you don't have to worry about them in
your firewall.
4. Standard Linux controls can be used to run OliveTin as non-root, with `sudo`
permissions if needed. See the action customization section of these docs for
more details.
