=== Themes

Temporary docs until I write something better.

If you're using a container, bind mount a "themes" directory from your host into /var/www/olivetin/themes/

If you're using a Linux package create a directory /var/www/olivetin/themes/ 

Create a directory called "mytheme"

Set your theme in your config

[source,yaml]
.`config.yaml`
----
themeName: myTheme
----

Add your css into /var/www/olivetin/themes/mytheme/theme.css

Your theme css will be loaded "on top" of the existing stylesheet.

To test it is working, set your theme CSS to something ridiculous like;

----
body {
    background-color: red !important;
}
----

Profit.
